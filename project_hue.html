                      We conducted face to face interviews with entry-level engineers in tech companies to learn the real situation.

                      in a professional setting.
                      Issues that came up included a lack of responsibility over big tasks

                    who seek and provide mentorship.
                    We first made the IA on the right, and then refined it below.

                  In our original design, users have to send a mentorship request
                  to get connected with mentors or mentees, but before sending a request,
                  users can have a chat with the potential mentors or mentees to get to
                  know if the person really matches to the user’s need. Main confusitions are:

                  <p class="lead text-justify">
                    As our app focuses on work environments, and encourages users to express their thoughts on sensitive issues,
                    I personally had a difficult time to consider how to ensure users to feel safe to use our app. Since the user research,
                    I tried to be careful to achieve confidentiality and feeling of connection at the same time through our app.
                    In my opinion, we successfully created the mentorship function, the progress visualization, and the discussion board to
                    tackle the users' main pain points.
                  </p>

                  <p class="lead text-justify">
                    If I were to do this project again, I would consider more about how to encourage both mentors and mentees to keep
                    using our app. If users cannot see their mentors / mentees in person, it may not be easy to stap motivated to send messages.
                    Thus, I would think of a reminder function of sending following messages, or a suggestion function to meet up in person.
                    In addition, for our hi-fi prototype, I decided to use distinct colors to imply "inclusion of diversity", but it turned out
                    some people feel distracted to see strong colors fighting again each other on the screens. Therefore, I would also change the
                    color theme next time.

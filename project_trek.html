                Trek’s features to plan safer runs. Our interviews revealed discussions of how family and
                friends expressed safety concerns so we wanted to include a persona that exemplified this.
                She represents the solo female runner who enjoys her outdoor activities

                When a user plans an activity, they can look up a new or existing route

                A user can also track their own route which utilizes GPS tracking technology.
                Users can send updates to trusted contacts, like when they expect to complete an activity.

                <b>Ecological Perspective:</b>
                Our app consists of users’ personal portals but is also part of a larger network
                of Trek users and other outside sources. It has three main functions:
                planning an activity, updating trail/route information and
                looking up your history of activities.
              </p>

                <b>Interaction Perspective:</b>
                The user will physically use the phone when completing tasks like
                planning a route or looking up trail information but can either put their phone away
                so they can fully enjoy their outdoor activity.
              </p>

              <p class="lead text-justify">
                <b>Emotional Perspective:</b>
                We envision our app to allow users to enjoy the outdoors without the burden of worrying
                about personal safety. The user has the ability
                to update trusted contacts with information on their wellbeing which instills
                a sense of security for both parties.

                the details of the screens.
                This proved to be an effective exercise as
                we identified main scenarios together but then were able to bring more specific details.
                I show one example here, in which a user plans to go running in a place where he/she often
                goes, but he/she noticed that a crime just happened there. Then, he decided to plan
                to go to a different place on the app.

                Based on the evaluation, we found some problems on the

                  <h3 class="mb-3">What I learned from this project.</h3>

                  <p class="lead text-justify">
                    At the very first stage of this project, even though we all agreed to
                    create an app for "safety", I was thinking safety in the urban setting
                    while my teammates thought more about safety in nature. This difference
                    made the progress slower at the beginning, so I think we should have spent
                    more time on the initial concept and agreed on the trajectory of the
                    project. However, our onsite contextual inquiry including interviews and
                    observations helped me a lot to understand the current condition and
                    the scope of this project.
                  </p>

                  <p class="lead text-justify">
                    For the ideation and design stages, I struggled with what functions our
                    app should include and what to ignore. Since our topic was very broad (safety and
                    enjoyment of outdoor activities), it was not easy for me to conclude which
                    specific painpoints we would address. Based on the models, persona, and storyboards,
                    we decided to focus on "trail conditions", and so in our app, users can see the current conditions
                    easily at the time of planning and doing activities. However, through the user testing,
                    participants were confused about some of the concepts, such as "update".
                    Thus, I learned the importance of user testing to fill the gap between designers and users
